	Today I realized that instead of calculating the distance from the centres of the block AND the player, 
I should be calculating the distance from the corner of the block and the centre of the player. Implementing now.

Also, this was the first day of the devlog.

OK! So the issue with collision was the fact that the depthVec was not being calculated correctly, getting the 
absolute value of the entire calc instead of just the distVec.
Next issue is the player floating. I think it will be an easy fix, just moving the ground sensors downwards (also
moving them outwards so that the player won't slip off of edges)
Fixed!
Next issue is the entity being pushed out from the blocks (colliding) too violently. Trying to make it more
constant... Not too sure how to do that. It may be caused by the collision box being moved forwards before the actual player...
Nevermind.....
Adding in extra delta loop, updating everything. I hope this was the source.
Didn't work. I think it may be caused by the entity's speed being changed so violently. Implementing changes...
Nope.
AHAHAHAHA!!! It was actually the fact that the collision reaction had a line that made sure that the depth was more than 0
0.0 is not the same as 0
Got rid of the line of code. All collision (w/ blocks) works perfectly.
Now comes the issue of a player being able to jump off the side of blocks. I have a suspicion that this is caused by
the gravity sensors being too close to the sides of the player.
I was right!
Next issue is the fact that the player can catch on the sides of walls. I feel as though this is caused by the fact that
the player can bring one of the collision sensors inside of a wall (normally getting it pushed out to the side) and the node
gets stuck in between of two blocks... Skipping it for now.................................................................................................... TODO
Next is the problem with taller entities. I tried to make more collision sensors (1 node per block space), but that didn't work.
Next thing I'm going to try... I have no idea what to do...................................................................................................... TODO
Now to implement entity collision (entity to entity)
I'm going to try and 'passively' push entities away from each other (push 0.01 away constantly or something) so that they
can still pass each other, and to reduce clumping............................................................................................................. TODO

	Tonight I will spend a little bit of time contemplating what the issue is with taller entities, and how I can
fix them. The following is a list of my thoughts:
 - An initial thought was the fact that the collision prediction was dividing the predicted collision coords by the size.
I changed to multiplication. Seems to have made things worse...
 - If the height is more, the centre is more far away from the collision, making it seem as though it is deeper... Instead of  <----- WORKED
depthVec being distVec - TILE_SIZE, it should be - (TILE_SIZE/2 + (size*TILE_SIZE)/2). It seems to have reduced error!
 - Player is a little glitchy (going up when they should be going out, bouncing), so I'll add more contact points and leave
it there for now, even if it doesn't work. YAY! OK, bye now.
